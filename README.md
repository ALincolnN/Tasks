# Tasks

This is a Django Backend project implementing the Django REST Framework to create CRUD APIs and a PostgreSQL database.

Styling is done by utilizing custom CSS,Bootstrap CSS classes,HTML and javascript for Frontend

The aim of the project is to have a Web-based Tasks application that essentially allows you to Add tasks, Update existing tasks, Delete them and Cross them if completed.

When a task is first created, the default 'Completed' value is set to 'False'. When clicked, it is crossed and the value is set to 'True'.

The tasks are set to always display in the order they were created, the most recently entered is displayed first.

Enjoy ;)
